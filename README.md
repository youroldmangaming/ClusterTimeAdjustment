1. **GPS Data Check**:
   - Running `sudo cat /dev/ttyS0` checks if the GPS device is sending data. This is a good first step to ensure the GPS is working properly.

2. **Installing Chrony and GPS Services**:
   - You’ve installed `chrony`, `gpsd`, and `gpsd-clients`, which are essential for synchronizing time using GPS data.

3. **GPSD Configuration**:
   - The configuration settings for GPSD you included in `/etc/default/gpsd` are set to automatically start the daemon and specify the device (`/dev/ttyS0`) for reading GPS data.

4. **Chrony Configuration**:
   - The `chrony.conf` settings specify GPS as a reference clock with a stratum of 10. The use of SHM (Shared Memory) is typical for integrating GPS time with NTP. Ensure your GPS device is configured to communicate with Chrony using the SHM interface.

5. **Enabling and Starting Services**:
   - You've enabled and started both `chrony` and `gpsd`, which is crucial for the services to run on system boot and immediately.

### Recommendations

- **Stratum Level**:
  - If your GPS is functioning correctly and providing accurate time, you should adjust the stratum level in your `chrony.conf`. Set it to `stratum 1` for the GPS to indicate it’s a primary time source. The line in your configuration should look like this:
    ```plaintext
    refclock SHM 0 refid GPS stratum 1
    ```

- **Monitoring GPS Data**:
  - After starting the GPSD service, you can use the `cgps` command (from `gpsd-clients`) to see real-time GPS data in a user-friendly format. This will confirm that GPS data is being read correctly.

- **Check Chrony Status**:
  - After configuring and starting the services, use the following commands to check if everything is functioning correctly:
    ```bash
    chronyc sources
    chronyc tracking
    ```

- **Logs for Troubleshooting**:
  - If you encounter issues, check the logs for both `gpsd` and `chrony` to troubleshoot. You can view logs with:
    ```bash
    sudo journalctl -u gpsd
    sudo journalctl -u chronyd
    ```

### Additional Resources
- For more on configuring GPSD, refer to the [GPSD documentation](https://catb.org/gpsd/).
- The [Chrony documentation](https://chrony.tuxfamily.org/manual.html) can provide in-depth explanations on NTP settings and configurations.

If you have any specific issues or errors while running these commands, feel free to ask!
